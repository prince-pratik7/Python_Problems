''' “I was driving on the highway the other day and I happened to notice my odometer.
Like most odometers, it shows six digits, in whole miles only. So, if my car had 300,000
miles, for example, I’d see 3-0-0-0-0-0.
“Now, what I saw that day was very interesting. I noticed that the last 4 digits were
palindromic; that is, they read the same forward as backward. For example, 5-4-4-5 is a
palindrome, so my odometer could have read 3-1-5-4-4-5.
“One mile later, the last 5 numbers were palindromic. For example, it could have read
3-6-5-4-5-6. One mile after that, the middle 4 out of 6 numbers were palindromic. And
you ready for this? One mile later, all 6 were palindromic!
“The question is, what was on the odometer when I first looked?”
Write a Python program that tests all the six-digit numbers and prints any numbers that satisfy
these requirements.'''
